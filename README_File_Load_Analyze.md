# Venmito Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this data engineering project for Venmito. We're excited to see how you tackle this challenge and provide us with a solution that can bring together disparate data sources into an insightful and valuable resource.

Venmito is a payment company that allows users to transfer funds to other users and pay in participant stores. The company has several data files in various formats. Our goal is to organize all of this information to gain insights about our clients and transactions. We believe that there is an immense value hidden in these data files, and we are looking for a solution that can help us extract and utilize this value.

We have five files:

- `people.json`
- `people.yml`
- `transfers.csv`
- `transactions.xml`
- `promotions.csv`
